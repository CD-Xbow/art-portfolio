# Welcome to My Art Portfolio Database
  This app helps you organize, view, and search your artworks and creative projects. All data is stored locally in your browser or as static files (no server needed).
  
  Main Features
  
    - Display, add, edit, and delete artworks
    - Store text, images, video, audio, and file links for each work
    - Search and filter your records using any field
    - Import/export your database as JSON for backup or transfer
    - Responsive and works on all modern browsers
  

 ## How to Use
  
    
      1. Display: View each artwork in detail (media right, details left). Use Next/Prev buttons to browse.
      
      - Click an image to enlarge in a popup.
      - Click video/audio to play.
      - Click links to open related pages in a new tab.
      
    
    
      . 2Table View: See all records in a sortable table.
      
        Edit or Delete any record here.
    
    
       3. New Record: Add a new artwork. Fill in fields and save. 
     
       4. Editing: Accessed from Display or Table View.
      
        Type and Primary Artist fields are dropdowns for consistency.
        Materials/Collaborators can be comma-separated lists.
        For media, enter the relative path or URL (e.g., images/myart.jpg).
        Links: Paste up to three URLs for external pages (gallery, shop, etc.).

      5. Search 
    
        Search: Filter works by any field (dropdowns for type/artist). Results appear below the form.
    
    
       6.Config:
      
        Edit database directly as JSON (advanced).
        Export your database as a backup (JSON file).
        Import a JSON file (replaces database).
        Restore default dummy data or clear everything.
      
      Tip: Always export a backup before making bulk edits in Config.
    
    
       7.Help: This screen. You can reopen it any time.
    
  

  ## Deployment Notes
  
    To use images, videos, or audio, upload them to your site in the referenced folders.
    If using on a new PC or browser, export and import your JSON database to migrate your records.
    Puter.com and most static web hosts support this app. No backend or database server is required.
  
  
  ## Troubleshooting
  
    If you don't see your records, ensure your browser allows localStorage.
    If images/media do not load, check file paths are correct and files are uploaded to the server.
    For further customization, edit the HTML/CSS/JS files directly.
